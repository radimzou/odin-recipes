        <li>4 big onions</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>0.5 kg of sauerkraut</li>

        <li>salt</li>
        <li>cumin</li>

        <li>pork fat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            At first we need to prepare our meat - cut it to semi-small pieces (about 5 cm)
        </li>
        <li>Chop the onions to soft pieces</li>
        <li>In a big pot fry roughly meat pieces in order to close the meat juice in it</li>
        <li>Once the meat is roughly fried, put the meat out of the pot onto a plate</li>
        <li>Then add a fat to the pot and fry onion pieces very slow for more than 20 minutes. Stearing is must have! During this frying add some cumin and salt</li>
        <li>Then add half of minced garlic cloves and fry it for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Then add whole amount of red pepper and stear it for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Once this mixture is fried well add the meat into the pot with black pepper (also with the leftover juice from the plate)</li>
        <li>Stear it for more than 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add a broth (reduced with hot water or fully prepared before)</li>
        <li>Boil it for more than 90 minuts on a soft fire</li>
        <li>Add some spice according to you taste (more salt, pepper, cumin)</li>
        <li>Once a taste is comfort, turn off the fire on a cooker and let it be for the whole night</li>
        <li>Next day start cooking again: turn on the cooker</li>
        <li>Once goulash is boiling grab the fat layer from the surface of the goulash into a mug = this is called "Glanc"</li>
        <li>Mix some flour with water in another mug and add it into a pot in order to goulash be more thick. Boile for more than 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Put the "Glanc" back into the pot, add the rest of the minced garlic and marjoram.</li>
        <li>Put the "Glanc" back into the pot, add the rest of the minced garlic and marjoram.</li>
        <li> Boil for another 2 minutes and YOUR GOULASH IS READY :-)</li>
        <li>For side dish prepare some dumplings</li>
        <li>Bon apetite! :-)</li>
    </ol>
